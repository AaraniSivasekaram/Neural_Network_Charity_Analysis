# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis
## Overview of the analysis: 
The purpose of this analysis was to create a neural network using the dataset of Alphabet Soup's funded organizations (over 34,000 organizations) to be able to predict whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup. The dataset from the funded organizations was preprocessed using tools such as "one-hot encoding" and bucketing. Data was split into target and feature arrays, further split into training and test datasets and scaled. A neural network model was built using two hidden layers, the model resulted in 73% (0.7255) accuracy when being evaluated. Attempts to optimize the neural network model to achieve an accuracy of 75% and above were not successful.

## Results: 
Using bulleted lists and images to support your answers, address the following questions.

### Data Preprocessing
What variable(s) are considered the target(s) for your model?
What variable(s) are considered to be the features for your model?
What variable(s) are neither targets nor features, and should be removed from the input data?

### Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model
How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?
Were you able to achieve the target model performance?
What steps did you take to try and increase model performance?

## Summary: 
Summarize the overall results of the deep learning model. Include a recommendation for how a different model could solve this classification problem, and explain your recommendation.
